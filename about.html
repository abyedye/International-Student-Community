                         <h2>Our Story</h2>
                         <p>About 90% who comes to us as an international student or as a green card holder gets victimized of the scam. Basically, the scam is like a phone call which asks you for your information and money by telling that the victim that they have won the money price or sometimes with the threat of getting kicked out of the country.</p>
                         <p>It is obvious the place is new and we get scared at first as we come to the land of opportinities and the only hope we have is to make our future better. We think what happens if we are let go from this country thats the trick scammer use and we can easily fall under it. Anytime you get call and don't have any idea on what to do, contact us or the one who you can trust around you. We are here to help you and never ever let scammer take benefit from you.</p>
